# POIproject
Point of Interest project (developed for Software developing class, 2014)

This is my first Java project, developed with 2 more of my colleagues (with 1 for the first part of it).
Unfortunately can't find the code for the second phase of it, but I found our really self-explanatory pdf of the API we made.
It is a huge project which will be very helpful to greek-speaking friends. 
Code for the database we made is not included, but there are some pictures of representations of it (through workbench) in our pdf.

There is also code for the android app we made later for it lying around (this class had 3 projects total), I hope I can find it someday... :)
